Plan the smallest correct change for a GitHub issue, then hand the plan off for a cheaper worker to execute. You do the
thinking so the executor doesn't have to. **Do NOT write implementation or test code** — only the plan. Argument:
`$ARGUMENTS` = issue number.

**GitHub CLI:** all commands use `gh`.

**Run at higher effort.** Planning is where over-engineering is prevented or introduced — reason hard about the
*smallest* change before committing to the plan.

## Step 1 — Read the Issue

```bash
gh issue view <number> --comments
```

Nail down: what's actually broken or needed, expected vs. actual behavior, and the real acceptance criteria (this
repo's issues use a `Goal` / `Scope` / `Definition of done` / `Out of scope` format — treat those verbatim as the
acceptance criteria and the scope boundary). If the body has a `Depends on` line, confirm that issue is closed before
planning against it.

## Step 2 — Explore Before You Plan

- `grep`/`glob` for the function/class/keyword names from the issue to find the true source files.
- Read the affected code **and** its existing tests (learn the naming, fixtures, assertion style — this repo uses
  pytest; check `tests/` for the current layout).
- Hunt for reusable helpers/utils/patterns already in the repo — the plan must reuse, not reinvent.
- Note the test command: `pytest -v` for the full suite, `pytest -v -k "<name>"` targeted (see work-issue's
  `references/test-commands.md`).

## Step 3 — Pick the Smallest Correct Change (ponytail ladder)

Stop at the first rung that holds, and record which one in the plan:

1. Does this need to be built at all? (YAGNI)
2. Does it already exist in this codebase? Reuse it.
3. Does the stdlib / an installed dep / a native feature already do this?
4. Can it be one line?
5. Only then: the minimum code that works.

If it's a bug: find the **root cause**, not the symptom. Grep every caller of the function you'd touch — fix the shared
function once rather than patching one call path and leaving siblings broken.

## Step 4 — Write the Plan to the Handoff File

Write the plan to the path given by the caller (fan-out uses `../issue-<number>-plan.md`, a sibling of the worktree so
it's never committed). Use this format:

```markdown
# Plan: #<number> <title>

## Root cause / goal

<what and why, 2-4 sentences. For bugs: the actual cause, not the symptom.>

## Ladder rung

<which rung the change stops at, e.g. "Rung 2 — reuse existing `foo` helper">

## Files to change

- `src/path/to/file.py` — <exact function/class and what changes>

## Reuse (do not reinvent)

- <existing helper/pattern to use, with its path>

## 🔴 Red — tests to add

- `tests/path/to/test_file.py::<test name>` — <exact behavior it asserts, tied to acceptance criteria>

## 🟢 Green — minimal implementation

<the smallest approach that makes the tests pass. No code, just the approach.>

## The one runnable check

<the single check that fails if this logic breaks (unless the change is a trivial one-liner)>

## Out of scope — do NOT touch

<files/behaviors the executor must leave alone, to prevent scope creep — copy the issue's own "Out of scope" line>

## Open risks

<edge cases, calibration needs, or unknowns the executor should watch>
```

## Step 5 — Hand Off

Return: the plan file path and a 2-3 sentence summary (root cause + chosen rung + number of tests planned) so the caller
can launch the cheaper execution worker.
